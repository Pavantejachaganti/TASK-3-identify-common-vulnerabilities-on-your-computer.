Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) is free software that is used to detect and manage vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. It provides various services and tools for vulnerability assessment such as identifying and analyzing security issues such as misconfigurations, outdated software, and weak passwords that could be exploited by attackers.

OpenVAS consists of a server and various client-side tools for scanning and reporting. It uses a regularly updated database of known vulnerabilities and checks systems against these to detect potential weaknesses. The tool performs a comprehensive scan of the specified targets, identifying potential vulnerabilities such as outdated software, misconfigurations, and weak passwords and generates comprehensive reports detailing the identified vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation.

Components of OpenVAS architecture:

OpenVAS Scanner:
The primary engine that performs the actual scanning of target systems. It uses Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs) to detect security vulnerabilities.
OpenVAS Manager:
Manages scan configurations, schedules, and stores scan results. It acts as an intermediary between the scanner and the user interfaces, handling scan requests and processing results.
Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA):
A web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to manage scans, configure settings, and view scan results. It provides an easy-to-use platform for interacting with OpenVAS.
OpenVAS CLI:
A command-line interface for users who prefer scripting and command-line operations. It enables management of scans, targets, and results through commands and scripts.
Greenbone Security Feed (GSF):
A continuously updated feed that provides the latest Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs) and security information. It ensures OpenVAS can detect the most recent vulnerabilities.
OpenVAS Libraries:
These libraries provide essential functionalities required by the scanner and manager, such as network communication, data storage, and cryptographic operations.
Database:
The database stores scan results, configurations, and other essential data. It ensures data persistence and retrieval for analysis and reporting purposes.

Greenbone is a company that developed and maintains the open-source vulnerability scanning tool called OpenVAS. OpenVAS was originally a fork of the Nessus scanning tool. While OpenVAS is the name many people still use, it's now part of a larger vulnerability management system called Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM).
